Order Delivery Date plugin allows the customers to choose a delivery date on the checkout page. The WooCommerce delivery date will be displayed while viewing the order. The plugin is fully integrated with WooCommerce. 

== Description ==

We believe that the post-purchase customer experience is as important as the acquisition process. That is why we built the [Order Delivery Date plugin](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/store/premium-plugins/order-delivery-date-for-woocommerce-pro-21/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=topprolink&utm_campaign=OrderDeliveryDateLite). It helps you to **improve your customer service** by delivering the orders on the customer's specified date.

The plugin allows your customers to choose a delivery date on the checkout page. This reduces **cart abandonment by 50%**.

><strong>A perfect plugin</strong>, says what it does and adds the functions simply with no fuss. I even had additional support when I wanted to tweak the plugin to fit my site better. Would recommend this to everyone.
> - [creaselambert](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/just-what-i-needed-and-no-fuss/)

You can set **minimum required time for delivery** in hours. The mandatory field setting will allow the delivery date field to be set as mandatory on the checkout page.

The dates on which you do not deliver can be set as holidays in the calendar. Also, you can **disable delivery for Virtual or Featured products**.

### This plugin allows you to do the following

* Ability to allow the customer to select <strong>Delivery date</strong> on the checkout page for the orders.
* You can <strong>disable the weekdays</strong> on which you <strong>do not deliver</strong> the products.

>The <strong>plugin worked as described</strong> and is extremely <strong>well supported</strong> which is key. It works by ordering the order screen by default – latest orders first – or by the delivery date. All one has to do is use a simple checkbox to flick between their preferred method. The plugin developer has responded to a request I had inside a few hours and resolved it very professionally. 5 stars for the plugin and its support.
